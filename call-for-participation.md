We are happy to invite submissions to the first CUI@IMX workshop, exploring the challenges and opportunities of combining conversational user interfaces with extended and virtual reality. 
This workshop aims to connect those with an interest in this area with the concrete goal of enabling fruitful and long-lasting collaborations. As a starting point, this workshop will aim to be the incubation ground for new Provocations track papers submitted to the ACM Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) conference in 2024. 

##Main Topics of Interest
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following: (a) best practices and overlapping lessons learned from \textit{deploying} conversational agents in and out of XR/VR; (b) \textit{design} of conversational agents with access to XR/VR environmental knowladge; (c) \textit{methodology} and \textit{integration} of conversational systems within XR/VR; (d) \textit{evaluation} studies and practices (whether ``in the wild'' or in the lab); (e) \textit{adaptive} or \textit{grounded} conversational interaction; (f) ethical and legal challenges of conversational agents within XR/VR.

##Submission Information
We seek position papers that are 3 to 6 pages long, including figures, but excluding references. Submissions longer than six pages of content excluding references will be desk rejected and not reviewed.

All papers for the conference must be submitted in the same format as IMX papers. As such they should be submitted in PDF format and conform to ACM Proceedings specifications. Please note that we are following the general ACM SIG format (“sigconf”, double column format), not the SIGCHI format. Templates are available at this link (US letter). In addition, ACM has partnered with Overleaf, where you can start writing using this link directly (note that this Overleaf document uses the new ACM workflow by default, which is not what HRI is using; to fix this, make sure the document uses the “sigconf” document class, rather than the “manuscript,screen,review” document class that is enabled in the Overleaf document by default).

Admittance to the workshop will be based on the overall quality, novelty, and relevance of the submission, and the organizers’ goals of bringing together a set of presenters that can represent the diverse and multidisciplinary facets of philosophy, design, and engineering required for the design of CUIs for and with XR and VR. We will pay particular attention to under-served regions or universities. Papers should be submitted via EasyChair by May 12th. At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the IMX conference (including or only workshop registration) and attend the workshop.

##Publication
Accepted papers will be posted to the workshop website ahead of workshop date and serve as the basis of presentations and discussion at the workshop.
