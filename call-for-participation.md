We are happy to invite submissions to the first CUI@IMX workshop, exploring the challenges and opportunities of combining conversational user interfaces with extended and virtual reality. 
This workshop aims to connect those with an interest in this area with the concrete goal of enabling fruitful and long-lasting collaborations. As a starting point, this workshop will aim to be the incubation ground for new Provocations track papers submitted to the ACM Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) conference in 2024. 

##Main Topics of Interest
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following: (a) best practices and overlapping lessons learned from deploying conversational agents in and out of XR/VR; (b) design of conversational agents with access to XR/VR environmental knowladge; (c) methodology and integration of conversational systems within XR/VR; (d) evaluation studies and practices (whether ``in the wild'' or in the lab); (e) adaptive or grounded conversational interaction; (f) ethical and legal challenges of conversational agents within XR/VR.

##Submission Information
_*Submissions are not mandatory*_, and will not be archival, however if you wish to present your work during the workshop and have an greater influence on what is discussed we welcome submissions on related topics. 

We seek position papers that are 3 to 6 pages long, including figures, but excluding references. Submissions longer than six pages of content excluding references will be desk rejected and not reviewed.

All manuscripts must be submitted in English in the New SIGCHI Extended Abstracts Format 

Templates are provided to author papers in this format for both Microsoft Word and LaTeX (inc. Overleaf):

- LaTeX — Download the [ACM’s LaTeX ZIP file](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip), directly available from the ACM.
- LaTeX (with Overleaf) — For online collaborative writing, authors can create an Overleaf project using [this template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sigchi-extended-abstract-template/zzzfqvkmrfzn).
- Microsoft Word - As this is not going through TAPS, Word users can take advantage of the [Old Extended Abstract Template.](https://chi2020.acm.org/sigchi-chi20-sample-ea)

Submissions should be made via EasyChair by midight April 11th, AOE 

Papers will be selected to be presented at the workshop based on the overall quality, novelty, and relevance of the submission, and the organizers’ goals of bringing together a set of presenters that can represent the diverse and multidisciplinary facets of philosophy, design, and engineering required for the design of CUIs for and with XR and VR. We will pay particular attention to under-served regions or universities. 

At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the IMX conference and attend the workshop.

##Publication
Accepted papers will be posted to the workshop website ahead of workshop date and serve as the basis of presentations and discussion at the workshop.
